Description:
This HTML document demonstrates the basic structure and interactivity using client-side JavaScript for the Milestone 1 project in IT 3203. 
This project focuses on creating a simple website with three pages (Home, About, and Contact), styling it with CSS, and adding basic interactivity using JavaScript.
Each page contains relevant content, and the navigation menu allows users to navigate between pages.
The script.js file handles basic client-side scripting, such as form validation and toggling elements.

worked on all 3 web pages, css style sheet, and javascript. Adding them to the git hub nuw. should have done itterative saves but just kept the computer running for the last few days as I worked on this.
files being added now 8:18pm.

Next itterations:
add php stuff, add more js bank end stuff, add top button to about page in the footer. Play with the css a little more, maybe not have the boxes all the way across the screen and change some fonts, do some bolds and underlines maybe?
