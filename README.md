Description:
This HTML document demonstrates the basic structure and interactivity using client-side JavaScript for the Milestone 1 project in IT 3203. 
This project focuses on creating a simple website with three pages (Home, About, and Contact), styling it with CSS, and adding basic interactivity using JavaScript.
Each page contains relevant content, and the navigation menu allows users to navigate between pages.
The script.js file handles basic client-side scripting, such as form validation and toggling elements.
