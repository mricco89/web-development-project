        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <!-- Description -->
        <p>My name is Matthew Ricco. I am married and have 2 children. 
        One is 1 year old, and the other is 5 years old. I work full-time 
        as a Linux engineer using Yocto. I have a passion for anime, gardening, 
        gaming, and playing drums. I attended Overbrook High School in Pine Hill, 
        NJ, graduating in 2007. Initially pursuing a teaching degree at Camden County 
        College, I shifted my career path towards game cabinet design, amusement ride 
        repair. This put my college path on hold for some time. Around 2016, I relocated 
        to Roswell, GA, where I continued my education remotely while working. I 
        served as the QA manager for a game design company before transitioning into 
        Linux and hardware engineering role within the same company. During this time, 
        I also began pursuing a bachelor's degree program at Kennesaw State University.</p>

        <p>My career journey has been marked by diverse experiences and a relentless
        pursuit of growth. At the age of 20, I achieved the role of District Manager 
        for an arcade company, demonstrating early leadership and management skills. 
        However, I soon realized that the earning potential did not align with the 
        commitment required, prompting a transition to the IT department of a 
        pharmaceutical company. Despite several years of dedicated service and even 
        relocating with the company to Georgia, I found myself at a standstill in terms 
        of professional growth after six years. Recognizing the need for a change, I 
        made the bold decision to pursue further education in Linux administration and 
        information systems while transitioning to a Quality Assurance role at a gaming
        company. Although this move initially meant a reduction in pay, the opportunity 
        for personal and professional growth in a rapidly expanding company with a 
        transformative journey from 30 to over 200 employees was undeniable. Balancing 
        my roles as a full-time father and employee, I committed to steady progress by 
        undertaking about five classes annually towards completing my bachelor's degree 
        at KSU, acknowledging the limitations of my time and responsibilities.</p>

        <p>My goal with pursuing further education was to advance my career and increase my
        earning potential. Encouraged by my wife, who holds a masterâ€™s degree and enjoys 
        professional success, I was motivated to elevate my own qualifications and 
        opportunities. Pursuing schooling not only aligned with my aspirations for personal 
        growth but also with the desire to contribute more substantially to my family's 
        financial stability. As I progressed in my career, I recognized the importance of 
        continuous learning and skill development, leading me to pursue higher education to 
        enhance my expertise and open doors to more rewarding opportunities. While my current 
        focus lies in Linux engineering using Yocto, I aspire to delve deeper into the realm 
        of engineering, particularly in board design and programming. However, the demands of 
        my current commitments limit the time I can allocate to pursue a formal degree in this 
        field. Nevertheless, I am eager to expand my skills in areas such as C programming and 
        Yocto programming for ARM and Intel chips. My passion for engineering drives me to seek
        opportunities for professional development and hands-on experience, paving the way for 
        future growth in this dynamic field.</p>
